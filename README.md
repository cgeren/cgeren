- 👋 Hi, I’m @cgeren, a fulltime Lehigh Univeristy undergraduate. 
- 👀 I’m interested in full stack web development, along with data science and that stuff because it seems interesting, but I know nothing about the latter.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and JS more completely through building my own Spotify Playback Website! It's under construction so it isn't public yet...but it's getting there.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! Reach out to me. My knowledge is relatively limited at the moment but I really like to learn. 
- 📫 How to reach me: cdg225@lehigh.edu
